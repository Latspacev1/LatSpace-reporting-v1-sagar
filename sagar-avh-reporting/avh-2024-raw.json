The rating agencies perform their rating calculations based on the information disclosed by the company and seek standard and comparable information (read: the more a company discloses information the most likely it is to get a higher rating from ESG agencies). \r\nTherefore, clear and structured reporting is paramount to ensure they collect and capture all the relevant information reported. In some cases, company performance is compared to sector performance (i.e. the company's score are then relative to its industry). \r\nRemark: \r\nIt is to be noted that these rating agencies use different metrics and rating methodology (e.g. some focus on managed vs unmanaged risk, others on risks and opportunities, some weigh specific focus aspects more than others like GHG emissions, …). These discrepancies in methodology largely explains the differences that can be noted in the ratings they grant.\r\nThe possible answers are:\r\n- CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) \r\n- Sustainalytics \r\n- MSCI \r\n- Vigeo Eiris \r\n- Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) \r\n- FTSE4Good \r\n- Bloomberg \r\n- ISS Oekom \r\n- RobecoSAM \r\n- Trucost \r\n- EcoVadis \r\n- SPOTT \r\n- Other (please describe in comments) \r\n- None of the above",
