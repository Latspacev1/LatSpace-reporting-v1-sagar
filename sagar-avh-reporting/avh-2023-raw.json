The rating agencies perform their rating calculations based on the information disclosed by the company and seek standard and comparable information (read: the more a company discloses information the most likely it is to get a higher rating from ESG agencies). \r\nTherefore, clear and structured reporting is paramount to ensure they collect and capture all the relevant information reported. In some cases, company performance is compared to sector performance (i.e. the company's score are then relative to its industry). \r\nRemark: \r\nIt is to be noted that these rating agencies use different metrics and rating methodology (e.g. some focus on managed vs unmanaged risk, others on risks and opportunities, some weigh specific focus aspects more than others like GHG emissions, …). These discrepancies in methodology largely explains the differences that can be noted in the ratings they grant.\r\nThe possible answers are:\r\n- CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) \r\n- Sustainalytics \r\n- MSCI \r\n- Vigeo Eiris \r\n- Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) \r\n- FTSE4Good \r\n- Bloomberg \r\n- ISS Oekom \r\n- RobecoSAM \r\n- Trucost \r\n- Other (please describe in comments) \r\n- None of the above",

Hence it should:\r\n- Monitor the correct and consistent application of the company's accounting standards and valuation rules \r\n- Review the internal control systems in order to ensure that the main risks (including those relating to compliance with existing legislation and regulations) have been properly identified, managed and disclosed, \r\n- Review the effectiveness of the internal audit\r\n- Make recommendations to the board of directors on the appointment or dismissal of the external auditor as well as his remuneration and other conditions of appointment and review its independence and performance, and \r\n- Monitor management’s responsiveness to the findings of the internal audit function and to the recommendations made in the external auditor’s management letter.\r\nIf the functions 1, 2 and 5 are performed at least, and such a formalised mission is given to a committee of the board , you can answer yes.\r\nGiven its role in risk matters, sometimes, the committee may also be called “audit and risk committee”, unless the board opts for a separate risk committee. (Source: 2020 Belgian Code on Corporate Governance).\r\nIf the committee limits its role to purely financial or risk matters, you can only select the appropriate committee. Sometimes a company choses explicitly to have its full board to act as an audit committee, in meetings dedicated mainly to audit matters. In that situation you can also answer yes to an audit committee.\r\n\r\n- Remuneration committee: a remuneration committee should support the BoD or management to meet its oversight responsibilities in relation to the company’s top management.\r\nIn particular it should make recommendations regarding the nomination, evaluation, promotions, dismissal or remuneration of top management, the nomination, dismissal and remuneration of Directors, as well recommendations regarding the composition of either top management or the Board of Directors.\r\nThe duties of the Committee may also include reviewing, and making recommendations to the BoD or management on the company’s human resources policies and practices in general, diversity & inclusion, or in relation to the health, safety and other related aspects.\r\nYou can answer yes if the remuneration committee performs at least all topics related to top management.The possible answers are:\r\n- Audit committee  \r\n- Remuneration committee \r\n- Risks (management) committee \r\n- Other (please describe in comments) \r\n- No",
